# Group-developed Puzzle Game
For this project I was the lead developer. I organized the other members. I wrote around 70% of the code. And I did the vast majority of the bug fixing. The game is a puzzle game where the player needs to unlock a door by collecting crystals. They can't see any of the wall unless they press a button to reveal them temporarily. A CONTROLLER IS REQUIRED.
